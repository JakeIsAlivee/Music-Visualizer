This is being worked on, but it works just fine in this state right now

It only works with .wav files

Buttons:
	T - Transparent window
	O - Always on top window
	Up arrow - Volume up
	Down arrow - Volume down
	C - Close the program
	Esc - Go to settings and back
	Theese buttons work in settings and in the visualizer


Have fun!
